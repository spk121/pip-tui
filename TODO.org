* Widgets
** TODO label
   Param: label text

   A block of text in a panel, maybe with a frame.

   It has no return value.
** TODO terminal
   Param: text maybe containing selectable links

   A block of text in a panel.  The characters are revealed one at a
   time at some character-per-minute rate.  There is a sound for each
   character when it appears.  There is a hard-drive grinding sound
   when the characters start to print. Clicking the mouse makes all the
   characters appear.  Clicking on the mouse makes a sound.

   Some on-screen text may be selectable links.  Text denoted as
   selectable links are enclosed in square brackers. Mousing over them
   highlights them. Clicking them selects.

   Returns the selected on-screen link, if any.
** TODO big dialog
   Param: text button-one-text button-two-text

   A block of text with one or two push-button choices.  Mousing over
   a button highlights the button, and makes a sound. Clicking a
   choice selects, and makes a noise.  There is a frame.

   It returns the pressed button.
** TODO inline menu
   Param: an alist of keynames and short labels.

   A horizontally oriented menu of choices.  Each choice has
   a letter in a circle that indicate the shortcut key to press
   to choose that choice.

   Returns the selected element.
** TODO tab frame
   Param: a list of tab names?

   This is a top-bar of tabs. Selecting a tab is supposed
   to bring up a new screen of data, hiding panels not
   associated with the selected tab, and showing panels associated
   with the selected tab.

   This isn't supposed to return anything, but, instead switch
   contexts.
** TODO ncurses menu - simple list
   Param: a list

   Given a list, it uses the menu driver to help select
   an element of the list.

   Returns the selected item.
** TODO ncurses menu - key value list
   Param: an alist

   Like the LIST, but, with two columns, a key and
   a description.

   Returns selected item.
** ncurses menu with explanation
   Param: an alist

   Like the LIST, but, On the left side, the keys of the line, one per
   line.  On the right side, the val of the highlighted key, which is
   supposed to be an explanation of KEY.  The KEY is expected to fit
   on one line, but, the EXPLANATION can be multiple lines.

   Returns selected item.
** TODO progress bar
   Param: a key and a fraction

   A label and a progress bar.

   No return value.
** TODO block-drawing image
   Param: an array of argb32

   Draws the array with block drawing characters.

   No return value
** TODO ncurses form
   Param: ?

   Somehow takes a simple scheme construct and automagically
   creates a form using the ncurses form library.
   
   Somehow returns the data in the form.
** TODO gps position
   This queries the gpsd daemon for the current position of the computer
   and displays the lat, lon.  Ideally, it would also conver that
   lat/lon into a neighborhood name.

** TODO audio stream
   This non-visual widget plays an ogg stream from Icecast.

* Libraries
** Audio
   Some widgets make noise.  Two paths to noises: guile-gstreamer,
   or custom wrap Alsa, pulseaudio.
** Audio streaming
   The radio widget plays online radio stations.  guile-gstreamer is
   probably the way to receive that data in the widget.  IceCast2 is
   probably the way to send that data, for testing.
** GPS Position
   One widget shows the name of the region.  Can't do that without
   a position database, but, we could show the GPS position.
** Images
   Some widgets have images.  Need a library to decode an image to
   an ARGB32 array, and then convert that into ASCII graphics.
** Raster graphics
   To be really stupid, you could use the xterm Tektronic drawin
   primitives, but, most terminals don't support those.
